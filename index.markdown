intro: 'At the heart of a good meal, as in good therapy, is the practice of loving
  kindness: the path of compassion, connection and curiosity for what it means to
  walk on human turf.  Therapy kitchen uses a love of food, storytelling and people
  to enhance relationships with ourselves, each other and our world.  Abandoning notions
  of perfection, we find potential, possibility and pleasure take its place.  Central
  to this approach is the relationship between food and love, using cooking and conversation,
  on their own or in combination, are the basis of a truly holistic therapeutic experience.'
