  Therapy Kitchen - because the kitchen's beat is the heart of a home, we
  use food, cooking and therapy, on their own or in combination, to make our world
  a happier place
meta-desc:
  'At the heart of good therapy, as in a good meal, is the practice of loving
  kindness: an understanding of what it means to walk on human turf. Through an appreciation
  of food, symbolism and people, Kitchen Therapy seeks to enhance relationships with
  ourselves, each other and our world. Letting go notions of perfection, we find potential,
  possibility and pleasure take its place. Central to this approach is the relationship
  between food and love, using cooking and conversation, on their own or in combination,
  as the basis of a truly holistic therapeutic experience.'

      Charlotte's enthusiasm and passion for life spills over into all her kitchen therapy classes, rekindling an inner eagerness to enter the kitchen once again.
      Her awareness of the emotions connected to our eating habits, healthy nutrition and cookery, offer skills in supporting self care and well being, playing an enormous role in our mental health today.
      Nurturing kindness back to the self in nourishing ways can only build confidence and aliveness, deepening further relationships to family, social and community through fun, healthy and creative cookery which Charlotte's classes truly ignite.

      "Thank you Charlotte for a truly unique, delicious and educative experience!
      \ I was unsure what to expect from kitchen therapy. It has turned out to been
      an extremely enjoyable and educative experience. As a fairly confident cook ‘off
      recipe’ I have been surprised at the amount of practical knowledge I have learnt
      from Charlotte. Charlotte has definitely taught me to be more confident with flavours
      - key lesson; more lemon juice! As for the therapy part, well there has been something
      extremely tribal about sitting around with the other participants (who just happened
      to all be women) sharing the chopping and preparation chores and swapping advice
      and tips about cooking. This sounds a bit 1950s and not very modern day feminist
      but it is a far more ancient instinct than that, giving a feeling of going back
      to medieval or tribal living. Which I think is a positive that has been lost in
      modern day living. \n\nI have tried a number of the recipes with some fantastic
      success and often together with my 12 year old daughter who is dyslexic and suffers
      with her self confidence. She made one of the recipes entirely on her own with
      just me reading out instructions. When she finished she said it tasted just perfect
      and said she was very proud of herself - it was delicious."

      Absolutely changed my whole perspective on food.  For years I've struggled
      with my weight due to medical conditions and had no appetite.  I came along to
      do cooking courses out in nature and I can't begin to describe the difference
      it's made.... I am always promoting this when others feel they're struggling with
      their mental health or appetite, as it has honestly given me hope.  Thank you.

    quote:
      When my teenage daughter was in the middle of her eating disorder, reflecting
      on my relationship with food with Charlotte, my own fear of making mistakes when
      cooking was exceptionally helpful in thinking that our attachment wounds could
      in part be healed by changing our relationship with food... cooking is no longer
      the source of great anxiety... I never thought it possible to take such joy from
      cooking and in feeding my family.  It has been a transformative experience.

      It was so nice to be outside, with other women going through similar stuff,
      coming together and chatting whilst making a delicious meal.  It was relaxing
      and interesting cooking in a different environment - the great outdoors.  Picking
      our ingredients was also a new experience which I loved.  My confidence has grown
      so much... inspiring me to grow my own vegetables and herbs to use at home.
