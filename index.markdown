page-title: Therapy Kitchen - because the kitchen's beat is the heart of a home, we
  use food, cooking and therapy, on their own or in combination, to make our world
  a happier place
meta-desc: 'At the heart of good therapy, as in a good meal, is the practice of loving
  kindness: an understanding of what it means to walk on human turf. Through an appreciation
  of food, symbolism and people, Kitchen Therapy seeks to enhance relationships with
  ourselves, each other and our world. Letting go notions of perfection, we find potential,
  possibility and pleasure take its place. Central to this approach is the relationship
  between food and love, using cooking and conversation, on their own or in combination,
  as the basis of a truly holistic therapeutic experience.'
