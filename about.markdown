- title: Where I’m coming from
  body-copy: A recipe of personal and professional experience, skills and passions
    have fed into the creation of Therapy Kitchen.  People and communities, how and
    why they tick, have been an abiding fascination; through my practice of teaching,
    cooking and talk-therapy, I have been able to develop this interest, whilst finding
    a place of usefulness in my community.  Being able to express ourselves creatively
    and feel connected to our environment, are key aspects to our well being, which
    I focus on in my work, for myself and with others.
- title: Career path
  body-copy: After a first degree in Anthropology, I completed teacher training, that
    I was able to fit around my family.  Landing a job as drama specialist at a school
    for high functioning dyslexic and autistic spectrum pupils, I also learned about
    ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder).  Drama is a wonderfully flexible
    subject, lending itself to therapeutic input.  After a break from secondary education,
    I returned to a new kitchen classroom, teaching adults domestic cookery.  In the
    same year, I also began my training as a therapist.  Whilst thoroughly enjoying
    these as discrete occupations, their compatibility and potential to feed into
    each other, quickly became apparent.
- title: Currently
  body-copy: I am passionate about bringing pleasure centre stage in the kitchen and
    abandoning notions of perfection, that get in the way of good cooking, life and
    love.  To this end, I am compiling a therapeutic cook book, based around imaginative,
    intuitive cooking and how this can inspire wider creative confidence in the world
    outside the kitchen (I’m told there is one…)
