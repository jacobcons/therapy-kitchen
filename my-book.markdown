  How it all began...
  Some time during 2004 I began thinking about leaving my drama teaching job amid the curriculum changes that were disastrous for me and my neurodiverse students.  Their creative abilities stunted by an outdated syllabus of dry text, unsuitable (in my opinion) for any secondary classroom but for my dyslexic students was a tragic waste.  My own experience of school where I found myself struggling to focus and constantly in trouble trickled down my spine.  I knew I needed a new career where I could be myself, honour and enhance the creative spirit and feel useful.

  “Love the hand that fate deals you and play it as your own” Marcus Aurelius

  That evening as I looked hungrily in the fridge, I saw a meal appear which I remember felt delicious.  As I followed the feeling of making a dinner with what one has to hand, I remembered playing cards as a small child into my teens, with my wonderful Great Grandmother.  Each hand you are dealt you must play as it is, and that is where the seasoning of fun, luck and creative resource ignite your potential.  The key nutrients in this pass time are presence and attention - engaging fully in the process, setting the natural practicality of the human spirit free.  Play is vital for life. It is how we learn to feed and care for ourselves after all.

  An idea for a creative cookbook that could show the reader how to cook with intuition and instinct began to simmer.  A pack of playing cards who became a set of recipes, each with a character who showed you how, when and why to cook them, was on the boil.  The various salts and seeds of my personal and professional life combined into what would follow the journey of becoming a conscious cook.  Drama teaching had shown me how to practice physical theatre, personifying objects and allowing them to speak, the vital role of creative confidence and how to reach our unique potential.  The essence of love in each meal we make, however small or grand, formed the foundation of this project.  By enjoying the process of putting imagination, play and appetite together in the kitchen, we create a recipe for life.

  It was some years later that I trained as a psychotherapist where the idea for the ‘cooking cure’ took shape and gave the creative cookbook a new dimension and direction.  My earlier studies in anthropology, my fascination with Carl Jung's depth psychology and philosophy now fed into the cookbook that you can delve into today.  It is a long and evolving story which I hope will come alive in your hands…
