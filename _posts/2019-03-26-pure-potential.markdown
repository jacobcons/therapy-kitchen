Each day, as I prepare for work, I am reminded how fortunate I have a job I not only love, but consider an integral part of my life.  As part of my personal practice, each spring I undertake an Ayurvedic detox diet, which means eating Mung Bean Dahl for roughly ten days, based around a fasting day.  This is an opportunity to observe my current relationship with food, whilst giving my digestive system a supportive break, and an invigorating spring clean!

Regular research is also part of the job, so finding a therapeutic podcast - This Jungian Life - to listen to whilst I walk my hound, works a treat. I was intrigued by their episode on 'Food Purity and Dietary Restriction' whilst I was emerged in my own cleanse programme. Their discussion helped focus my sense of purpose and exploration during this quiet time; their topics so often seem to synchronise with where I am which I find reassuring, inspiring a sense of purpose and connection.  

'Eating clean' as it's referred to in my clinic, is the latest health kick, and appears to be a great idea.  However, as with all the discussions in this area - 'food and mood', weight loss etc, the focus remains on the food (the object) itself. The vital significance of how it gets there, the background preparation, we too often ignore, avoid or take for granted.  

As a kitchen therapist, it is what the food means and how it is made that is the primary focus.  Clearly, as this cleanse diet shows, the physical nutrition is crucial, but I am aware that it's not just **what** I eat, but **how** I make it that will address my needs.  The quality of my attention, the nature of my intentions in the cooking choices I make and the stories they tell, are the crucial ingredients in providing a complete, fulfilling meal.  If you have seen the effect of Tita's food in "Like Water for Chocolate" (and if you haven't - allow me to recommend this film/book?), you will know the significance of the emotional ingredient in our cooking.  My Ayurvedic cooking teacher explained that when a mother makes her children's breakfast, she infuses the porridge with her loving protection for the day.  The food we eat tastes of the care it took to make it, and this is the sustenance which lasts a lifetime.

Although I am fond of the nutrition packed, cleansing mung dahl, after a few days, its healthy charm can wane... That's when I focus in on the nurture I receive from this dish, which is the ultimate in self care diets.  I take time to chop and prepare all the ingredients, paying close attention to their sensory delights. I spend a little extra time using my pestle and mortar, which brings me in touch with my own caring energy as well as the traditional methods, passed down over millennia for creating this meal.  I notice a warm feeling of security as I connect psychologically to this ancient healing recipe, grateful for the time and trouble I am feeding into myself. Active self care.

I first took on this Ayurvedic detox diet 10 years ago, and it marked a key moment in Kitchen Therapy's genesis. At the time, I was suffering with allergies and knew I needed to take responsibility for what was happening in my body, to care for myself and address some unhelpful, outdated habits around what and how I was fuelling myself.
