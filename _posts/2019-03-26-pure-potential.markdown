Each day, as I prepare for work, I am reminded how fortunate I have a job I not only love, but consider an integral part of my life.  As part of my personal practice, each spring I undertake an Ayervedic detox diet, which means eating Mung Bean Dahl for roughly ten days, based around a fasting day.  This is an opportunity to observe my current relationship with food, whilst giving my digestive system a supportive break, and a natural spring clean!

Regular research is also part of the job, so finding a therapeutic podcast - This Jungian Life to listen to whilst I walk on the Downs, is an absolute treat. I was intrigued by their episode on Food Purity and Restriction whilst I was emerged in my cleanse programme. Their discussion helped focus my sense of purpose and exploration during this quiet time; helping me feel inspired and connected as their topics so often synchronise with where I am in life.  

Eating clean as it's often called, seems to be the new health fad, and appears to be a great idea.  However, as with all the discussions in this area - food and mood, weight loss etc, the focus remains on the food itself, missing the vital significance of how it gets there - the background preparation, that we can ignore, avoid or take for granted.  As a kitchen therapist, it is what the food means and how it is made that is the focus for the work.  Clearly, as this cleanse diet shows, the physical nutrition is crucial, but I am aware that just what I eat, but how I make it that will address my needs.  The quality of my attention, the nature of my intentions in the cooking choices I make and the stories they tell, are the crucial ingredients in providing a complete, fulfilling meal.

Although I am fond of the nutrition packed, cleansing mung dahl, after a few days of eating it, the healthy charm can wane... That's when I really focus in on the nurture I receive from this dish, which is the ultimate in self care diets.  I take time to chop and prepare all the ingredients, paying greater attention to their sensory delights. I spend a little extra time using my pestle and mortar
