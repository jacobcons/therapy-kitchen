One of the most poignant posts I have seen is that Nature has sent us all to our rooms. What that means for us, is going to be completely different, but one thing is for sure - we are all going to be faced with our underlying attachment issues.  that is, our relational patterns and stories, our wounds of unmet needs, with their attendant defences will be surfacing now as isolation may be forcing us to face ourselves. Not easy. But, nothing worth having is.
We may well feel that we're being unfairly punished
