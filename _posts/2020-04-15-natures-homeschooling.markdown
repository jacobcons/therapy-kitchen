One of the most poignant posts I have seen is that Nature has sent us all to our rooms. What that means for each of us, will be our personal story, but one thing is for sure - we are all going to be faced with our underlying attachment issues.  that is, our relational patterns and stories, our wounds of unmet needs, with their attendant defences will be surfacing now as isolation may be forcing us to face ourselves. Not easy. But, nothing worth having is.
We may well feel that we're being unfairly punished, a sense of deprivation, fears for the future, worry for others, disbelief in the system... whatever meanings we attach to outer reality will depend on our internal world beliefs, that interpret, filter and relate to  the world around us.
One of the key ways of coping that I have is to keep busy, specifically, to keep useful.   Being useful is crucial to maintaining my sense of relational connection to the world, reminding my sneaky self reliant aspect that I need others, that I am part of a pack-herd of profoundly, globally interrelated beings living on a planet, in a universe which is equally interconnected... The consideration that I am sharing this experience with each blade of grass, star in the sky, rabbit on the downs
