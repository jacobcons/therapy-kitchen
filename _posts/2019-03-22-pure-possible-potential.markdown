A highlight of my week is listening to [This Jungian Life Podcast](http://www.thisjungianlife.com/heres-the-podcast/) - three Jungian analysts discussing issues of the day and dreams of the month, that stimulates my own thinking whilst lending me the feeling that i have 3 new therapeutic parents to call on for support.  I find their work both comforting and inspiring, amazed to find how often the topics they choose chime with where I am and what I need that week.  Last week, as I was in my Ayervedic detox programme (involving eating Mung bean dahl for 10 days more or less - less on the day you fast completely - yes, it's a challenge) they discussed [food purity,](http://http://www.thisjungianlife.com/episode-49-dietary-over-regulation-and-the-pursuit-of-purity/) one i see with clients wanting to 'eat clean'. So, once again our paths crossed - they truly are my folks!
Everyone is taken aback that I will be restricting my diet to mung dahl for 10 days, partly from their own perspective, but also from knowing me and my food focused mind, they wonder how (and why) this will work... I explain that my allergies have been so bad, I am motivated to cleanse on a physical level. On a psychological level, my addictions (caffeine, phone, sugar and more) lead me to distraction - clouding my mind with their noisy clamour for attention, leading back to the physical irritations I suffer. I am looking for clarity, compassion and care to guide me, rather than my default search for salvation in the outer world. My ego head often demands a mood changing lift from a gulp of espresso or spoon of ice cream - by meeting the itch, it comes back stronger and I'm on the hamster wheel - again.  
It's particularly annoying to find oneself here, when one specialises in working with addiction, and know myself well in this area. But of course, we always need help, the perspective to see what's going on in our minds, which this therapeutic Mung dahl diet gives me.  The comfort food represents is ever present in my personal and professional life. The key that I work on, is separating the psychological comfort I need from the physical food I want, working towards inner alignment that desires healing.  As a kitchen therapist, I know it's not just the food i eat, but how I make it, that will answer my need. the quality of my attention, the nature of my intentions in the cooking choices i make, are crucial ingredients in the cleansing process. Essentially, I need mind body and spirit, my child, parent and adult self, all to pull together in the shared aim of feeling better - in myself.
Given the longevity and apparent strength of my food urges, it always amazes me how I suffer little or no sense of craving when I do this diet.  It is true that the spices, mung beans and ghee work hard to satisfy; but it has as much to do with my state of mind, how nurturing I am in the making of the dahl. I notice the pleasure I get from the practical and playful task of cooking the medicinal dahl for myself.  As the food itself is not so exciting (day after day after all...), I focus attention on the process of making it, to fulfil my sense of desire, taking satisfaction from my commitment to looking after my inner world.
