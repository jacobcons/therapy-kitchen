A highlight of my week is listening to [This Jungian Life Podcast](http://www.thisjungianlife.com/heres-the-podcast/) - three Jungian analysts discussing issues of the day and dreams of the month, that stimulates my own thinking whilst lending me the feeling that i have 3 new therapeutic parents to call on for support.  I find their work both comforting and inspiring, amazed to find how often the topics they choose chime with where I am and what I need that week.  Last week, as I was in my Ayervedic detox programme (involving eating Mung bean dahl for 10 days more or less - less on the day you fast completely - yes, it's a challenge) they covered the topic of [food purity,](http://http://www.thisjungianlife.com/episode-49-dietary-over-regulation-and-the-pursuit-of-purity/) one i see with clients wanting to 'eat clean'. So, once again our paths crossed - they truly are my folks!
Everyone is taken aback when i explain that I will be restricting my diet to mung dahl for 10 days, partly from their own perspective, but also from knowing me and my food focused mind, they wonder how (and why) this will work... I explain that my allergies have been so bad, I am motivated to cleanse on a physical level. On a psychological level, my addictions (currently caffeine and sugar) lead me to distraction - clouding my mind with their noisy clamour for attention, leading back to the physical irritations I suffer. I am looking for clarity, compassion and care to emerge, rather than my default position of looking for salvation in the outer world.
