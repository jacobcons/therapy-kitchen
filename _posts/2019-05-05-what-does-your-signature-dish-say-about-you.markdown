One of the key aspects of Kitchen Therapy is that the way we eat, how we cook, reflects something significant about who we are, how we feel and what we might need.  One way in to this conversation with ourselves, is to think of a favourite meal, or a signature dish.  Remembering where you first had it, what's special about it and so on.

Having one of my better ideas, I decided to invite myself for lunch a while back now, with an ex student.  She was of Albanian decent and in the process of opening her own cafe, show casing food that she had learned to cook from her Albanian father and his family.  It was a delicious meal which she was enormously proud of.  One of the things that we talked about was how long this culture's food takes to cook, the designed outcome, she believed, to keep women in the kitchen!  It was fascinating how she had interpreted the culture for her own life style, running a cafe almost from home, as a family affair.

Recently, I invited a dear friend for lunch, to tell me about her signature dish.  On her way to work, Amanda arrived in characteristic bohemian chic, full of Brighton breezy laughter.  I had made the wild garlic, mushroom miso soup that is my current favourite dish, as I know she's gluten, dairy and mainly meat free.

How to make the soup: 
1. collect wild garlic (out of season use garlic cloves and peas instead)
2. Chop a mushroom, if time and fridge allows, an onion and celery stick too.
3.  Saute the celery and onion if using (as the wild garlic is of the onion family, you can do without), with a bay leaf and generous grind of black pepper (putting it in now, seals in its hot spiciness for a healthy kick).
4. Boil a kettle
5. Add the mushrooms to the pan, saut√© for a minute or so
6. Add boiling water and spoonful or so of the following flavours - stock, soy sauce, rice vinegar, sweet chilli sauce, zest and juice of a lime or lemon - taste check your way through!
7. Take it off the heat, stir in your miso paste, about a spoonful per bowl full and finally 
8. Chop in your wild garlic, final taste check, and if you need, super quick blast of extra heat (not too much as you will weaken the miso and garlic raw power blast)
9. Serve to self and or friend with sigh of content (how good does it get?).
