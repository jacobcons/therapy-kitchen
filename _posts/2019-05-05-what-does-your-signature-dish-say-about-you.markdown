![IMG_0779.jpg](/uploads/IMG_0779.jpg)One of the key aspects of Kitchen Therapy is that the way we eat, how we cook, reflects something significant about who we are, how we feel and what we might need.  One way in to this conversation with ourselves, is to think of a favourite meal, or a signature dish.  Remembering where you first had it, what's special about it and so on.

Having one of my better ideas, I decided to invite myself for lunch a while back now, with an ex student.  She was of Albanian decent and in the process of opening her own cafe, show casing food that she had learned to cook from her Albanian father and his family.  It was a delicious meal which she was enormously proud of.  One of the things that we talked about was how long this culture's food takes to cook, the designed outcome, she believed, to keep women in the kitchen!  It was fascinating how she had interpreted the culture for her own life style, running a cafe almost from home, as a family affair.

Recently, I invited a dear friend for lunch, to tell me about her signature dish.  On her way to work, Amanda arrived in characteristic bohemian chic, full of Brighton breezy laughter.  I had made the wild garlic, mushroom miso soup that is my current favourite dish, as I know she's gluten, dairy and mainly meat free.

**How to make the soup:** 
1. Collect wild garlic (out of season use garlic cloves and peas instead)
2. Chop a mushroom, if time and fridge allows, an onion and celery stick too.
3.  Saute the celery and onion if using (as the wild garlic is of the onion family, you can do without), with a bay leaf and generous grind of black pepper (putting it in now, seals in its hot spiciness for a healthy kick).
4. Boil a kettle
5. Add the mushrooms to the pan, saut√© for a minute or so
6. Add boiling water and spoonful or so of the following flavours - stock, soy sauce, rice vinegar, sweet chilli sauce, zest and juice of a lime or lemon - taste check your way through!
7. Take it off the heat, stir in your miso paste, about a spoonful per bowl full and finally 
8. Chop in your wild garlic, final taste check, and if you need, super quick blast of extra heat (not too much as you will weaken the miso and garlic raw power blast)
9. Serve to self and or friend with sigh of content (how good does it get?).

Amanda is off to work (laughter yoga session today, which she often combines with chocolate making workshops - perfect combination), so we get straight into lunch and interview:
"Have we started recording already?" - yes, not to worry, this won't be a podcast of our spoon clinking lunch conversation! "Well, I found it really hard to think of what my signature dish would be, even if I'm following a recipe, I change it each time depending on my mood, what's inspiring me or what's in the cupboards." - so I guess creative 'of the moment' would be your signature dish? "Absolutely, but as my life is so busy, my head's often full of work, sales, accounting... so many facets to life, that my brain is often too full to be creative." ah, so what happens when there's no time to cook?  "Well yesterday lunch was an onion baji with tofu, red pesto and tuna.. was delicious! - I just have to be creative with the time and things I have!  what I like to do, is choose things that appeal to me during the day, little ideas and turn those into a meal"  mmm, du ever find, that having gathered what you fancy, what you ought etc during the day, that by the time you come to cook in the evening, you're over it, and can't be bothered? "Oh god yes (rather long, poignant pause) - like when I got married..." having planned the wedding, Amanda felt she'd done it, so she spent the money on a new kitchen instead!  Amanda never fails in her ability to spring delightful moments of surprise on me, but equally, as we delve into our relationship with cooking, somehow, all sorts of treasures are turned over.

When our composure returned, I asked Amanda what her dish of the moment would be. She went off to grab photos of the recipe that her rather lovely man had recently cooked for her, to her great pleasure (and that of her teenage lad).![3ed0a34c-dffe-4d64-8080-915b0a0126f7.jpeg](/uploads/3ed0a34c-dffe-4d64-8080-915b0a0126f7.jpeg)![8f7dbfd0-b745-4fe6-b7e4-12df3ffcff06.jpeg](/uploads/8f7dbfd0-b745-4fe6-b7e4-12df3ffcff06.jpeg)  Whilst cooking is satisfying, being cooked for is sublime.  

We went on to think about the past, and how she used to find cooking a full on nutritious meal for her son, an essential and rewarding daily task.  A simple and easy way to feel like a good parent.  However, when a long distance relationship came along, somehow, life came disrupted.  Now settled out of town, with the space to breathe, she's once again enjoying both cooking and being cooked for.  Returning this time, to that nurturing space, to look after (and be looked after) as being (almost) as important as caring for GCSE studying Ned.

As we talked through what it meant
