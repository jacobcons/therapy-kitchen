The first recipe we cooked on the farm was butternut squash/pumpkin soup.  This recipe comes from a dear Danish friend who cooked this for a family camping trip, enough to feed 50+ people.  I love its simplicity, its colour, its sweetness, its versatility, its ability to feed many mouths, its storecupboard availability, its cost... maybe like my friend who taught me the dish, I still have more reasons to love this marvellous meal!  

Cooking it outside, on an open fire, finishing in the clay oven, having picked the main ingredients ourselves, was an experience I shall never forget as my first, in what I now know will be many more!  The video clip shows me using a camping stove, as we can just get outside and make cooking special in simple ways!  Just lighting a candle when you serve dinner is reminiscent of the campfire warmth and comfort - so here's the recipe for you to play around with and make as you like it:
You will need:
Butternut squash, sweet potato, celery, onions/leeks, ginger, garlic - fennel seeds are nice if you have/like them, stock, mustard (don't like it? leave it out), soy sauce, lemon juice and rind, tin of tomatoes, tomato puree, turmeric, black pepper.

How to do it:
Chop your veg ready to go, into mouth sized/desired pieces.
Introduce each flavour into the pan separately to allow flavour to seal in and feel at home
