The first recipe we cooked on the farm was butternut squash/pumpkin soup.  This recipe comes from a dear Danish friend who cooked this for a family camping trip, enough to feed 50+ people.  I love its simplicity, its colour, its sweetness, its versatility, its generosity, its store cupboard ready-to-go-ness, its cost... like my friend who taught me the dish, I still have more reasons to love this magic meal!  

Cooking it outside, in a wood fired oven, having picked the main ingredients ourselves, was an experience I will treasure as a key moment for kitchen therapy.  The video clip from home, shows me using a camping stove, as we can just get outside and make cooking special in simple ways.  Just lighting a candle when you serve dinner is reminiscent of the campfire warmth and comfort... 

Some will find my lack of quantity or specifics tricky.  There are more directive places to go, but I know that you know more about how much to add of what, how you can swap things about and the ratio of ingredients to feed your family than I do.  This approach is all about your creativity and intuition leading the way, recipe as a guideline not prescription.  So here's the recipe for you to play around with and make as you like it:

**You will need:**
Butternut squash, sweet potato, celery, onions/leeks, ginger, garlic - fennel seeds are nice if you have/like them, stock, mustard (don't like it? leave it out), soy sauce, lemon juice and rind, tin of tomatoes, tomato puree, turmeric, black pepper.

**How to do it:**
* Chop your veg ready to go, into mouth sized/desired pieces.
* Introduce each flavour into the pan separately to allow flavour to seal in and feel at home

1.celery 2.ginger 3. onions/leeks 4. turmeric 5.squash 6. sweet potato 7.garlic (remember to keep adding garlic all the way thru as the flavour and efficacy cook away (fresh tomatoes, carrots also an option) 8. handful of red lentils per person (rough guide only)

Once it is all heated thru - adding more oil as necessary, you can add the liquid: tin of tomatoes, about 2 tins of water, getting all those tomato flavours out! You swap in coconut milk here instead, if you fancy a curry feel from the beginning, rather than turning round the next day into a new meal by adding either Thai or Indian spices (see below).  Let that cook for a few minutes and then begin the flavouring action... On that note, you may have liked some chilli in here, works a treat!

a few drops of:
* Soy sauce (remember: you can always add more!) this deepens the flavour, working especially well with tomatoes.
* Balsamic vinegar (or rice vinegar if going for curry flavour)
* Lemon juice - remember to use the zest first.
stock of your choice.
* Mustard if you dont mind it! (flavour mixes in well, its not as loud in a group as it is alone)
* maybe something sweet like pomegranate syrup, honey or sweet chilli sauce but this might not be necessary, it does however enhance the flavours in here 

Taste as you go along to judge how much more to add, or how to balance those flavours.  I always add more ginger and garlic at the end to support digestion and immunity and add flavour ummph

Serve with yoghurt, fresh herbs of your choice and rice or bread.

To make this into an curry, use coconut milk and curry paste/poweder of your choice, zest in lime, grate in more ginger, crush in more garlic, add in few drops more of rice vinegar, and there you go, meal switched up in moments - delicious! Just a small bit of creative energy each day, using left overs etc builds confidence and sense of turning up for yourself, that others will love too.  Try it.
