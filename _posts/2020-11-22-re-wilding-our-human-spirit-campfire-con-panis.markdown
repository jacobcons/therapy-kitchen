During Covid19 I have found myself (gratefully) busier than ever.  The place of cooking as a cornerstone of well being, of understanding food as potent medicine has never been more significant.

Kitchen therapy is all about finding our sense of belonging as a human soul in an often alienating world.  One where supermarkets often have machines rather than people to buy food from. Packaged and perfected vegetables straight-jacketed into the grocery version of size 0.  Seductive ready meals and sauces that offer to make our lives quicker and easier to satisfy, forgetting to ask our creative, intuitive, imaginative mind how satisfied it feels.

So, during lockdown and the challenges of isolation this has brought, many of us have found ourselves in the kitchen seeking solace, not just from the fridge opening with something ready to offer, but in the interaction of making food.  For many, there has been an opportunity (OK necessity) to return to simple, basic pleasures of making food for ourselves - as Nature intended. 

Cooking is fundamental to who we are as a species.  The access to such a variety of resources and the creative confidence it afforded us, whilst feeding our growing minds, our specific human relationship to food defines us as a species.
