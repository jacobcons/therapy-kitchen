Have you noticed the abundance of acorns, holly berries and the like this autumn?  Well, there they are and several people have now told me that the more nuts and fruit that appear on the trees, the harder the winter will be... as I was dwelling on this, the weather suddenly became harsher and their words came back, alongside the realisation that Nature prepares us for what lies ahead.  We are all getting the message that we need to plan (as She herself has done) for a long, hard winter, but Nature has also provided for us a wealth of fruits and nuts to store away.
A recent trip to my aunt in Worcester has given me a basket of crab apples to play with! Always a keen gardener, who enjoys providing a playground for her grandchildren and birds alike, she has a beautiful crab apple tree, and ever since i can remember, she has made crab apple jelly.  Sadly, she is now too unwell for such kitchen endeavours, but with her in mind, this week I am going to make the jelly in her honour. I am also going to make some tiny toffee apples for a treat my childhood tooth cannot quite resist...
