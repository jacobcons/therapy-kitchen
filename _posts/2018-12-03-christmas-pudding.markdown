This year, I have found the time and inspiration to have a go at Grandma's Christmas Pudding. She was famous in the family at large for making the very best there is, of this strange 'delight'. It's sticky-black-puddingness passes this child's sensitivities quickly by. However, Christmas is about giving and I have several people I know who will love this, should it work out ok... I am a bit nervous to say the least, as without my greedy tummy leading the way, I cannot be so sure it will have the in-greed-ient it needs!?

The first time I made it, under some telephone supervision, it worked beautifully, much to my other half's applause. The next time however, my haphazard, devil may care approach took over, and the result was nil pwan. I made a hasty retreat, as I so often have done in the face of failure, and gave up.  This however, is another year, and with my grandma no longer here, I feel the need to grow up a notch. Ive put tender loving care and research into the making of this year's traditional festive pudding, and time will tell if it has been a success or place of learning, or of course a combination of both.

The connection with my maternal heritage feels strong and empowering.  As I have shopped, prepared and made Grandma's Christmas Pudding, I feel connected across time. The traditional, passed down recipe, made over the space of a few days in the present, to be eaten in a month or so's time.  There is a secure sense of the movement of evolution, as this version is vegetarian, (tho not yet vegan), swapping trex for suet and adding some stout to make up the umami flavour... that's the plan, the proof of course, will be in the pudding...
