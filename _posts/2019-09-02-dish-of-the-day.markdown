I met Elijah as one of the guests at my daughter's 21st party here, he was playing the piano with a gentle certitude that caught my ear - I enjoyed getting to know more about him, and seized the opportunity to harvest his expertise into making the podcast I've been planning for nearly 10 years... Like making a meal, coordinating the timing is both crucial and tricky - finding someone who can offer the technical know-how/support and interest, to time with my space for action, has only just come together.  Over the preparation and cooking period, the concept of Kitchen Therapy has ripened.  The seed has taken root, the tree grown, and this podcast feels like its first fruit.
As Elijah and I talked about the purpose and content of the podcast, I realised that he was even more perfect for the job than I first thought!  He was philosophically and emotionally in tune with the ideas, was a calm and supportive sounding board, and has a delicious voice, with a helpful dollop of food enthusiasm.
