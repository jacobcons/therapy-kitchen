During the holidays, I am lucky enough to work for Chomp, family food and fun whilst schools are off.  I love this part of my working calendar, spending time with families and people that I wouldn't otherwise get the chance to meet.

I also love the fact that such a greenly healthy dish as pesto, goes down so well with the ubiquitously fussy child.  The idea of these workshops is to have fun together whilst making great food to share.  It is by coming together but making their own pesto, their own way, that helps get people on board.  I get people to test their way through quantities, using their intuition and senses to guide them.  One rule I use is: > > "You can always add more!"

We are all naturally attracted to fresh leaves somehow and cheese is an incredibly tempting ingredient (perfect ratio of protein to fat, that makes the brain tickled pink, so to speak!)  The fact that these leaves are freshly foraged from the woods over the road from where I live, adds to my sense of pleasure and flow.  Out of season, I use the same recipe with bought garlic, using growing herbs such as mint or the traditional basil, but always with my much adored, frozen pea.  Full of protein, sweetly green and packed with vitamins, housed in nearly everyone's freezer, they're a true kitchen trooper.

Here's how to do it:

1.  Pick some wild garlic from lowland woods. I am careful to avoid the flowers which I guess will be needed more in situ. Wash thoroughly and roughly chop.
2. Defrost handful (per person) or so of peas (if you've got some over, you can add as garnish or into a salad)
3.  Crumble in packet of feta (any cheese you like is fine, I just think this works the best)
4. If you have it, some cream cheese softens the flavours and adds more luxury.
5. Zest and juice of at least one lemon
6. Few glugs of olive oil.
7. Salt and pepper to taste (you might not need any salt with the garlic and lemon doing their tasty job so well)
