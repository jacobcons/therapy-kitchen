WHEN I RULE THE WORLD, the first thing I will do is exchange 'Bake *Off*' for a programme called 'Baking *With*'.  Yes, I do have a Walter Mitty fantasy life, in which one day I'm on Desert Island Discs, the next I'm in the stocks, too ashamed to even show my face.  In the real world, it is cooking that contains my neurotic imagination - where I can satisfy my hunger (which is huge) at the level of mind, body and spirit. My kitchen connects me with the here and now, with the ingredients, with the creativity of my recipe and with the people I cook for.  Because by sharing what I cook, whether that's in the preparation (I love a bit of help), in the audience (I love applause!) or simply connecting with the dish (I always fall a little in love), I am brought into the world of *belonging*. I feel *part of* my world when I take its resources and prepare a meal that I give to the table. Neurotic fantasies peeled away as compost fodder.

That's why I'd get rid of the competitive, 'who's the best?', **Bake Off**, and replace it with a gentler, more sustainably satisfying programme about *Baking With* one another.  Food is about relationship, connection, about tender-loving-*care*. I know that competition is attention grabbing, where we obsess over the perfection of the dish cooked - which is gone as soon as it arrives (especially if it's cake on my plate). Our target driven world focuses on what we *do* - the end product - and forgets, or ignores, the magnificent process of careful endeavour behind the dish - the effort, the intention, the flavour history, the memories, the human connectedness through food, that stretches across the time and space of our lives.  If we can remember, take the time, to *notice*.

I learned to cook and bake with my grandmother. A key moment that has seeded my career, was the taste of her tomato soup - made with the first home grown tomatoes of the season. An incredible, exquisite delight. The taste of gratitude spilled into my heart. That moment - of tasting her soup for the first time - continues to feed my world today.  The memory stirs my cookery, sometimes my therapy sessions, reminding me that nourishment is as much about *nurture* as it is about nutrition.


This summer, I have been lucky enough to lead family cooking workshops -sharing and exchanging skills, stories and resources. My 20-year old daughter took time to join in. I was proud of her.  Everyone liked my recipes (phew), enjoyed the food they made and, more importantly, the process of cooking together. I felt good.  We all did. As they realised how good their food tasted, the smiles, the surprised looks, on everyone's faces, were utterly priceless.  Whilst we all felt pleased with our produce, we were also alongside each other - in it together, each finding our place around the table.  

These sessions continue to inspire my work today and I am busy dreaming up new recipes for the autumn term. When we bake with, everyone wins.  More than that, the feeling we get from those moments lasts, long after the meal has gone, sustaining our creative, community spirit.  Competitive moments of winners and losers offer only short term satisfaction.  When their time is gone (*Off*!), we, cooks of the world, will replace it with: '*Baking With*'... Grandma...?
