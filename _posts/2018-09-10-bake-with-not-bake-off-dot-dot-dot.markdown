*When* I rule the world, the first thing I will do is exchange > Bake Off>  for a programme called > Baking *With*> ...Yes, I do have a Walter Mitty fantasy life, in which one day I'm on Desert Island Discs, the next I'm in the stocks, too ashamed to even show my face as part of the human race. It is cooking that contains my neurotic imagination in the real world, where I can satisfy my hunger (which is huge) at the level of mind, body and spirit. I connect with the here and now, with the ingredients, the meal and the people around me. Because I can share what I cook, whether that's in the preparation (I love a bit of help), in the audience (I love an applause!) or just with the dish itself (I always fall a little in love), I am brought into the world of belonging. I feel part of my world when I cook its resources into a meal that I take and give to the table.

That's why I'd get rid of the competitive, who's the best, Bake Off, and replace it with a gentler, more sustainably satisfying programme about baking with one another.  Food is about relationship, connection but most importantly, about tender-loving-care
