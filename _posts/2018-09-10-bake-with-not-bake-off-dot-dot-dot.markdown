*When* I rule the world, the first thing I will do is exchange > Bake Off>  for a programme called > Baking *With*> ...Yes, I do have a Walter Mitty fantasy life, in which one day I'm on Desert Island Discs, the next I'm in the stocks, too ashamed to even show my face as part of the human race. It is cooking that contains my neurotic imagination in the real world, where I can satisfy my hunger (which is huge) at the level of mind, body and spirit. I connect with the here and now, with the ingredients, the meal and the people around me. Because I can share what I cook, whether that's in the preparation (I love a bit of help), in the audience (I love an applause!) or just with the dish itself (I always fall a little in love), I am brought into the world of belonging. I feel part of my world when I cook its resources into a meal that I take and give to the table.

That's why I'd get rid of the competitive, who's the best, Bake Off, and replace it with a gentler, more sustainably satisfying programme about baking with one another.  Food is about relationship, connection, about tender-loving-care. I know that competition is attention grabbing, but that is here and gone. The focus is on the object cooked, which again, is gone as soon as it arrives (if it's cake on my plate). Our target driven world, focused on what we do forgets or ignores the magnificent process of careful endeavour behind that actually lasts a lifetime. If we remember, take the time, to notice.

I learned to cook by baking with my grandmother. A key moment that has seeded my career, was the taste of her first home grown tomato soup. Incredible. Exquisite. The taste of gratitude spilled into my heart.
