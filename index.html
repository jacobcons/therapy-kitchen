          data-full-quote="Thank you Charlotte for a truly unique, delicious and educative experience!  I was unsure what to expect from kitchen therapy. It has turned out to been an extremely enjoyable and educative experience. As a fairly confident cook ‘off recipe’ I have been surprised at the amount of practical knowledge I have learnt from Charlotte. Charlotte has definitely taught me to be more confident with flavours - key lesson; more lemon juice! As for the therapy part, well there has been something extremely tribal about sitting around with the other participants (who just happened to all be women) sharing the chopping and preparation chores and swapping advice and tips about cooking. This sounds a bit 1950s and not very modern day feminist but it is a far more ancient instinct than that, giving a feeling of going back to medieval or tribal living. Which I think is a positive that has been lost in modern day living. 

I have tried a number of the recipes with some fantastic success and often together with my 12 year old daughter who is dyslexic and suffers with her self confidence. She made one of the recipes entirely on her own with just me reading out instructions. When she finished she said it tasted just perfect and said she was very proud of herself - it was delicious."

Her awareness of the emotions connected to our eating habits, healthy nutrition and cookery, offer skills in supporting self care and well being, playing an enormous role in our mental health today.
Nurturing kindness back to the self in nourishing ways can only build confidence and aliveness, deepening further relationships to family, social and community through fun, healthy and creative cookery which Charlotte's classes truly ignite."
