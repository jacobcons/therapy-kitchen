intro: Cooking should not only give sustenance for our body but – like good art or
  music – it should nourish our soul.

  title: Our ethos
  desc: |-
    Cooking is as natural as eating… with some guidance and information, classes will inspire your intuition, your imagination and your appetite to lead the way, in your kitchen.  In this approach, recipes are starting points for you to personalize - adapting, researching and experimenting with ideas and ingredients, so that your cooking tastes just right, for you.

    Classes are built around the importance of enhancing relationships, with ourselves, each other and of course food.  We need to eat and are social creatures, so coming together in a supportive, friendly group to enjoy cooking good food, makes good sense in every way.
