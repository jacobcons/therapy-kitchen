intro: Cooking should not only give sustenance for our body but – like good art or
  music – it should nourish our soul.

  title: Our ethos
  desc: |-
    Cooking is as natural as eating… with some guidance and information, classes will inspire your intuition, your imagination and your appetite to lead the way, in your kitchen.  In this approach, recipes are starting points for you to personalize - adapting, researching and experimenting with ideas and ingredients, so that your cooking tastes just right, for you.

    Classes are built around the importance of enhancing relationships, with ourselves, each other and of course food.  We need to eat and are social creatures, so coming together in a supportive, friendly group to enjoy cooking good food, makes good sense in every way.

    Charlotte has such a gentle casual way that she makes taking charge of your health a very pleasant experience.

    Charlotte was one of my first cooking teachers and the first one to make me feel confident and unafraid of all the new foods and theories that just right for me as a beginner.

    She inspired all the students with her cooking, compassion and understanding; she is not only teaching in her class, she is also hands on cooking including all students’ participation.

    Charlotte’s Learn to Love Cooking Course helped me finally understand food and how to cook with love. Her teaching technique is so clear, easy and practical to understand, some of my favourite dishes are Fish Pie/ Risotto-Chicken/Mushroom and Leek/ Chocolate and Banana Cake and Chocolate Brownies.
