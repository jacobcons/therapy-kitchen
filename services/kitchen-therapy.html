	<h2 class="title text-center">Who is it for?</h2>
	<p class="text-wrapper">Kitchen Therapy is for anyone looking for a practical and productive form of therapy, conducted in a friendly and relaxed environment. It is for anyone looking to explore personal issues in a creative and sensory way. Below are some examples of Kitchen therapy in practice:</p>
	<div class="wrapper">
		<div class="cols cols--2-1">
			
				<div class="box cols__cell">
					<h2 class="box__title">Caring for oneself a (re) learning process</h2>
					<p>A young man who had grown up in care, struggled to care for himself as an adult.  We worked on developing a new, helpful inner parent by:</p>
					<ul class="box__list">
					
						<li>Planning weekly dietary/menu around his routines</li>
					
						<li>Considering his fitness and career aims and how his diet could support that</li>
					
						<li>Encouraging both nutritional and pleasurable elements in cooking</li>
					
						<li>Cooking together to support this process</li>
					
					</ul>
				</div>
			
				<div class="box cols__cell">
					<h2 class="box__title">A couple managing a life-cycle upheaval</h2>
					<p>The birth of their child, left a couple feeling a lack of attention from each other, as all their energy went on caring for their son.  Kitchen therapy helped them to rebuild their relationship by:</p>
					<ul class="box__list">
					
						<li>Using food as an exploratory tool, allowing us to understand and connect with their inner worlds</li>
					
						<li>Becoming aware of each others’ specific issues and needs around food meant this could be a focus for looking after each other</li>
					
						<li>Both enjoying cooking meant we could see food as a gift, carrying with it their time, care and attention.  Daily meals became an opportunity to feel and express love for one another.</li>
					
					</ul>
				</div>
			
				<div class="box cols__cell">
					<h2 class="box__title">Health issues requiring dietary changes</h2>
					<p>A young woman diagnosed with early onset diabetes, felt stuck with resentment and confusion at having to change her eating habits – kitchen therapy helped by:</p>
					<ul class="box__list">
					
						<li>Researching foods alongside her, to understand more about their nutritional impact and to develop recipes that would support her body chemistry</li>
					
						<li>We directed the focus onto what she could rather than what she could not eat, so food once again could become rewarding, rather than punitive</li>
					
						<li>By cooking alongside Martha, the process once again became pleasurable and doable.  She rediscovered her confidence and satisfaction in the process of cooking as equally important to what she was eating</li>
					
					</ul>
				</div>
			
				<div class="box cols__cell">
					<h2 class="box__title">Mother and Daughter bonding</h2>
					<p>The stresses of lifecycle changes, as a daughter became a young woman as her mother reached middle age, brought them into into Therapy Kitchen, which helped by:</p>
					<ul class="box__list">
					
						<li>Offering a neutral space to explore their changing needs and relationship with each other and with food</li>
					
						<li>Enjoying making good food together gave a new basis for communication</li>
					
						<li>By learning alongside one another, they were able to listen to each other again, re-establishing their relationship on a new, adult platform</li>
					
					</ul>

					<p class="testimonial__quote">"Thank you Charlotte for a truly unique, delicious and educative experience! "</p>
					<span class="testimonial__author">Abigail</span>
					<span class="link testimonial__more js-testimonial-more" data-full-quote="Thank you Charlotte for a truly unique, delicious and educative experience!  I was unsure what to expect from kitchen therapy. It has turned out to been an extremely enjoyable and educative experience. As a fairly confident cook ‘off recipe’ I have been surprised at the amount of practical knowledge I have learnt from Charlotte. Charlotte has definitely taught me to be more confident with flavours - key lesson; more lemon juice! As for the therapy part, well there has been something extremely tribal about sitting around with the other participants (who just happened to all be women) sharing the chopping and preparation chores and swapping advice and tips about cooking. This sounds a bit 1950s and not very modern day feminist but it is a far more ancient instinct than that, giving a feeling of going back to medieval or tribal living. Which I think is a positive that has been lost in modern day living. 

I have tried a number of the recipes with some fantastic success and often together with my 12 year old daughter who is dyslexic and suffers with her self confidence. She made one of the recipes entirely on her own with just me reading out instructions. When she finished she said it tasted just perfect and said she was very proud of herself - it was delicious.">Full quote</span>

					<span class="link testimonial__more js-testimonial-more" data-full-quote="Charlotte's enthusiasm and passion for life spills over into all her kitchen therapy classes, rekindling an inner eagerness to enter the kitchen once again.
Her awareness of the emotions connected to our eating habits, healthy nutrition and cookery, offer skills in supporting self care and well being, playing an enormous role in our mental health today.
Nurturing kindness back to the self in nourishing ways can only build confidence and aliveness, deepening further relationships to family, social and community through fun, healthy and creative cookery which Charlotte's classes truly ignite.">Full quote</span>
