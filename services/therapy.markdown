- title: Choosing therapy
  body-copy: We all, at some point in life, feel the need to ask for help with overwhelming
    emotional challenges or difficult experiences. Whatever brings us to therapy,
    it is often a hard choice to make however it is in the actual decision to ask
    for help that our healing can begin.  In my quiet garden studio on Brighton’s
    green outskirts, I practice a broad range of individual and relationship counselling.
- title: Who is it for?
  body-copy: Therapy maybe for a specific issue, challenge or change that you are
    dealing with; or it can be about a more general desire for self development; ultimately
    it is likely to be about both.  In that sense, therapy is useful for everyone
    at some point in their lives.
- title: My approach
  body-copy: "I practice an attachment based therapy, founded on the profound impact
    our primary care experience has on how we see, feel and act in the world.  This
    means looking at how long-buried childhood stories are somehow still echoing in
    our lives today.  Valuing both our conscious and unconscious memories, thoughts
    and feelings, therapy sheds light on confusing inner conflicts, bringing clarity
    to our pathway ahead. \n\nA wide experience in education and therapy has given
    me a rich understanding of how to work with and value each individual within our
    common human framework.  I incorporate an ever growing knowledge from my interests
    in philosophy, psychology and mythology into my creative, collaborative and holistic
    approach to therapy. "

  text-box: |-
    An initial phone conversation to introduce ourselves and understand how I can help.  I offer a half hour assessment, costing £15 to establish whether I am the right counsellor.

    We will normally agree to work on a weekly basis as the most effective schedule.  However each therapeutic relationship is unique and we will agree working patterns accordingly.
