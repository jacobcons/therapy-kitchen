- title: Choosing therapy
  body-copy: We all, at some point in life, face overwhelming emotional challenges
    or difficult experiences. Whatever brings us to therapy, it is often a hard choice
    to make however it is in the actual decision to ask for help that our healing
    can begin.  In my garden studio on Brighton’s green outskirts, I practice a broad
    range of individual and relationship counselling, enabling your healing journey.
- title: Who is it for?
  body-copy: Therapy maybe for a specific issue, challenge or change that you are
    dealing with, or a more general desire for self development - ultimately it is
    likely to be about both.  In that sense, therapy is useful for everyone, offering
    collaborative guidance and support, at key points in our lives.
- title: My approach
  body-copy: "I practice developmental, depth pyschology based therapy, founded on
    the profound impact our primary care experience has on how we see, feel and act
    in the world.  This means looking at how long-buried childhood stories are somehow
    still echoing in our lives today.  Valuing both our conscious and unconscious
    memories, thoughts and feelings, therapy sheds light on confusing inner conflicts,
    bringing clarity to our pathway ahead. \n\nA wide experience in education and
    therapy has given me a rich understanding of how to work with and value each individual
    within our common human framework.  I incorporate an ever growing knowledge from
    my interests in philosophy, psychology and spirituality in my holistic approach
    to therapy. "

    An initial phone conversation to introduce ourselves and understand how I can help.  I offer a half hour assessment, costing £15, to establish whether I am the right counsellor for your needs.

    We will normally agree to work on a weekly basis as the most effective schedule, in either a short term or open ended time span.  However each therapeutic relationship is unique and we will agree working patterns accordingly, within a flexible framework.
