what-is-it:
  desc: Kitchen therapy uses food and cooking to explore and enhance our relationships
    with ourselves, one another and our environment.  Looking at the importance of
    nurturing oneself and sharing food with others, helps us to connect with our creativity
    and passion, building positive feelings about ourselves and enabling helpful life
    changes.
  aspects:
  - title: Self care
    desc: Our first experience of love in the world is through food. Supported in
      the natural environment of the kitchen, we can rework our personal stories,
      feelings and patterns as we explore our relationship with food.  Our mindfulness
      around both the nutritional and emotional content of the food we make forms
      the basis of self-care - how this has been, how it is today and how we intend
      it to be.

  - title: Creativity and change
    desc: Cooking offers a direct connection with our unique human potential.  When
      humans discovered how to make and use fire, they were given their first taste
      of alchemy, one that ignited consciousness.  By bringing mindful attention to
      the preparation of today's food, we can connect with our inner capacity for
      change, agency and healing potential.

  - title: Campfire Con-panis
    desc: Our word company comes from the Latin, 'con-panis - with bread', reflecting
      the importance of food in terms of communication, community and connection.  Kitchen
      therapy looks to bring people together and increase our understanding of one
      another, through our shared need of food and friendship.

who-is-it-for:
  title: Who is it for?
  desc: 'Kitchen Therapy is for anyone looking for a practical and productive form
    of therapy, conducted in a friendly and relaxed environment. It is for anyone
    looking to explore personal issues in a creative and sensory way. Below are some
    examples of Kitchen therapy in practice:'
  examples:
  - title: Caring for oneself a (re) learning process
    desc: 'A young man who had grown up in care, struggled to care for himself as
      an adult.  We worked on developing a new, helpful inner parent by:'
    list:
    - Planning weekly dietary/menu around his routines
    - Considering his fitness and career aims and how his diet could support that
    - Encouraging both nutritional and pleasurable elements in cooking
    - Cooking together to support this process
  - title: A couple managing a life-cycle upheaval
    desc: 'The birth of their child, left a couple feeling a lack of attention from
      each other, as all their energy went on caring for their son.  Kitchen therapy
      helped them to rebuild their relationship by:'
    list:
    - Using food as an exploratory tool, allowing us to understand and connect with
      their inner worlds
    - Becoming aware of each others’ specific issues and needs around food meant this
      could be a focus for looking after each other
    - Both enjoying cooking meant we could see food as a gift, carrying with it their
      time, care and attention.  Daily meals became an opportunity to feel and express
      love for one another.
  - title: Health issues requiring dietary changes
    desc: 'A young woman diagnosed with early onset diabetes, felt stuck with resentment
      and confusion at having to change her eating habits – kitchen therapy helped
      by:'
    list:
    - Researching foods alongside her, to understand more about their nutritional
      impact and to develop recipes that would support her body chemistry
    - We directed the focus onto what she could rather than what she could not eat,
      so food once again could become rewarding, rather than punitive
    - By cooking alongside Martha, the process once again became pleasurable and doable.  She
      rediscovered her confidence and satisfaction in the process of cooking as equally
      important to what she was eating
  - title: Mother and Daughter bonding
    desc: 'The stresses of lifecycle changes, as a daughter became a young woman as
      her mother reached middle age, brought them into into Therapy Kitchen, which
      helped by:'
    list:
    - Offering a neutral space to explore their changing needs and relationship with
      each other and with food
    - Enjoying making good food together gave a new basis for communication
    - By learning alongside one another, they were able to listen to each other again,
      re-establishing their relationship on a new, adult platform
