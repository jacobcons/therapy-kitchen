what-is-it:
  desc: Kitchen therapy uses food and cooking to explore and enhance our relationships
    with ourselves, one another and our environment.  looking at the importance of
    nurturing oneself and sharing food with others, helps us to connect with our creativity
    and passion, building positive feelings about ourselves and enabling helpful life
    changes.
  aspects:
  - title: Self care
    desc: Our first experience of love in the world is through food. Supported in
      the natural environment of the kitchen, we can rework our personal stories,
      feelings and patterns.  Our mindfulness around both the nutritional and emotional
      content of the food we make forms the basis of self-care.

      therapy looks to bring people together and increase our understanding of one
      another through food.

who-is-it-for:
  title: Who is it for?
  desc: 'Kitchen Therapy is for anyone looking for a practical and productive form
    of therapy, conducted in a friendly and relaxed environment. It is for anyone
    looking to explore personal issues in a creative and sensory way. Below are some
    examples of Kitchen therapy in practice:'
  examples:
  - title: Caring for oneself a (re) learning process
    desc: 'A young man who had grown up in care, struggled to care for himself as
      an adult.  We worked on developing a new, helpful inner parent by:'
    list:
    - Planning weekly dietary/menu around his routines
    - Considering his fitness and career aims and how his diet could support that
    - Encouraging both nutritional and pleasurable elements in cooking
    - Cooking together to support this process
  - title: A couple managing a life-cycle upheaval
    desc: 'The birth of their child, left a couple feeling a lack of attention from
      each other, as all their energy went on caring for their son.  Kitchen therapy
      helped them to rebuild their relationship by:'
    list:
    - Using food as an exploratory tool, allowing us to understand and connect with
      their inner worlds
    - Becoming aware of each others’ specific issues and needs around food meant this
      could be a focus for looking after each other
    - Both enjoying cooking meant we could see food as a gift, carrying with it their
      time, care and attention.  Daily meals became an opportunity to feel and express
      love for one another.
  - title: Health issues requiring dietary changes
    desc: 'A young woman diagnosed with early onset diabetes, felt stuck with resentment
      and confusion at having to change her eating habits – kitchen therapy helped
      by:'
    list:
    - Researching foods alongside her, to understand more about their nutritional
      impact and to develop recipes that would support her body chemistry
    - We directed the focus onto what she could rather than what she could not eat,
      so food once again could become rewarding, rather than punitive
    - By cooking alongside Martha, the process once again became pleasurable and doable.  She
      rediscovered her confidence and satisfaction in the process of cooking as equally
      important to what she was eating
  - title: Mother and Daughter bonding

      her mother reached middle age, brought them into into Therapy Kitchen, which
      helped by:'
    list:
    - Offering a neutral space to explore their changing needs and relationship with
      each other and with food
    - Enjoying making good food together gave a new basis for communication
    - By learning alongside one another, they were able to listen to each other again,
      re-establishing their relationship on a new, adult platform

    experience! '
  quote: "Thank you Charlotte for a truly unique, delicious and educative experience!
    \ I was unsure what to expect from kitchen therapy. It has turned out to been
    an extremely enjoyable and educative experience. As a fairly confident cook ‘off
    recipe’ I have been surprised at the amount of practical knowledge I have learnt
    from Charlotte. Charlotte has definitely taught me to be more confident with flavours
    - key lesson; more lemon juice! As for the therapy part, well there has been something
    extremely tribal about sitting around with the other participants (who just happened
    to all be women) sharing the chopping and preparation chores and swapping advice
    and tips about cooking. This sounds a bit 1950s and not very modern day feminist
    but it is a far more ancient instinct than that, giving a feeling of going back
    to medieval or tribal living. Which I think is a positive that has been lost in
    modern day living. \n\nI have tried a number of the recipes with some fantastic
    success and often together with my 12 year old daughter who is dyslexic and suffers
    with her self confidence. She made one of the recipes entirely on her own with
    just me reading out instructions. When she finished she said it tasted just perfect
    and said she was very proud of herself - it was delicious."

    her kitchen therapy classes
  quote: |-
    Charlotte's enthusiasm and passion for life spills over into all her kitchen therapy classes, rekindling an inner eagerness to enter the kitchen once again.
    Her awareness of the emotions connected to our eating habits, healthy nutrition and cookery, offer skills in supporting self care and well being, playing an enormous role in our mental health today.
    Nurturing kindness back to the self in nourishing ways can only build confidence and aliveness, deepening further relationships to family, social and community through fun, healthy and creative cookery which Charlotte's classes truly ignite.

    and I have fallen in love with cooking again. It’s made such a difference to my
    sugar cravings and my mood! Can’t wait to do more!
